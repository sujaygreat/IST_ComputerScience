##Lab 6: Creating Tables, Primary and Foreign Keys
This lab provides you the opportunity to create tables, primary keys and foreign keys with the use of SQL commands. The lab will utilize the FLIX2YOU problem.

In the FLIX2YOU product document, there is an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) showing the current database schema for FLIX2YOU. You will also find a script file named FLIX2YOU_current.txt in the folder in Angel. The execution of the script file in SQL Server Management Studio will create seven of the fourteen tables for the FLIX2YOU database. The script will create the tables along with the primary and foreign keys for the seven table displayed on the left hand side of the ERD.

The first part of this lab you will use the script provided (FLIX2YOU_current.txtPreview the documentView in a new window) and execute the script in your own folder in VLABS SQL Server.

The second part of the lab you will create a data dictionary for the remaining seven tables (right hand side of the FLIX2YOU ERD). The data dictionary can be a formatted Word document or an Excel spreadsheet file. Please follow the format of the sample data dictionary found on table 3.6 on page 89 of the textbook. Then you will write and execute the SQL commands in VLABS SQL Server to create the seven tables and the primary/foreign keys for those tables.
